- the serial terminal baud rate in SDK  (and other settings) MUST
 be set to 115200 or else the ouput will appear garbled
  in the terminal window.  (I was under the misimpression that
one may specify any of the available baud rates , but this is
not the case)..

- update Lab 1 handout to more strongly emphasize this.
